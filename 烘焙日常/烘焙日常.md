The measure \\(\mu\\) is called \\(\sigma\\) **-finite** if \\(X\\) is the *countable union*  of measurable sets with finite measure. A set in a measure space is said to have \\(\sigma\\) **-finite measure** if it is a countable union of sets with finite measure.

For example, Lebesgue measure on the real numbers is not finite, but it is \\(\sigma\\) -finite. Indeed, consider the closed intervals \\([k,k+1]\\) for all integers \\(k\\); there are countably many such intervals, each has measure 1, and their union is the entire real line.
